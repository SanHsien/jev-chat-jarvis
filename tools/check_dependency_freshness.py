"""Compare declared dependency floors against their current upstream releases.

This fork's *own* declared dependencies are the dev tools in `requirements-dev.txt`
(pytest, ruff; fork maintenance tooling only) and the pinned GitHub Actions used by
`.github/workflows/*.yml`. Dependabot proposes upgrades one pull request at a time, which
answers "is there a newer release?" but never "how far behind is what we declare, across
every declaration in the repo?". This reads both sources, asks PyPI (for the Python tools)
and the GitHub Releases API (for the Actions) for the current release, and writes a
Markdown report.

The Android app's Gradle dependencies (`app/build.gradle.kts`, the version catalog-less
root build file and the Gradle wrapper) are deliberately excluded: they are upstream
product declarations tracked by the `gradle` Dependabot ecosystem in
`.github/dependabot.yml`, not by this script.

It compares declarations only. Nothing here inspects the installed environment and
nothing here edits a requirements file or a workflow: a newer release is a prompt to read
the changelog and run the suite, not a merge.
