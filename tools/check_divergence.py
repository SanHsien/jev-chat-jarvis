"""Enforce that `docs/DIVERGENCE.md` lists exactly the upstream files this fork has

changed or deleted since the reviewed baseline -- no more, no less.

This fork's stated policy (see docs/DIVERGENCE.md and docs/DECISIONS.md) is: track
upstream directly, accept divergence as the expected outcome, and write every
divergence down clearly enough that a future sync does not need to re-derive the
judgment call. A registry nobody checks drifts the moment
someone edits an upstream-owned file without adding a row, or deletes a row without
reverting the edit; this script is the machine check that keeps the two in sync.

It compares two sets:

- Every upstream-owned file (present in the repo at the reviewed baseline commit,
  `reviewed_through` in `tools/upstream_baseline.json`) that is modified or deleted
  between that commit and the current working tree (`git diff --name-status
  <base>`, which folds in both committed and uncommitted changes).
- Every file path registered in `docs/DIVERGENCE.md`'s table.

A file this fork only *adds* (never existed upstream) is not a divergence and is not
expected to be registered -- there is no upstream version to diverge from.

`README.zh-CN.md` is a special case: it holds upstream's original README.md content
(moved there so this fork's own README.md could be rewritten in Traditional Chinese),
but git cannot discover that by rename detection. Rename detection (`git diff -M`)
only pairs a *deleted* path with an *added* one; README.md is not deleted here, it is
modified in place with unrelated new content, so it is never eligible to be paired
with README.zh-CN.md no matter how similarity detection is tuned. This script therefore
hardcodes the association instead (see `RENAME_ALIASES` below) rather than attempting
content-similarity rename detection that git's own plumbing cannot perform here.

Git history has to actually contain the baseline commit for any of this to work. A
shallow clone (the default for many CI checkouts) or a machine that has never fetched
that commit cannot answer "what changed since then", so this degrades gracefully: it
prints a warning and exits 0 rather than failing a check that has no way to succeed.
